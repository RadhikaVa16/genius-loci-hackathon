# Genius Loci: Your AI Trip Co-pilot ??

**Innovating travel by moving from static itineraries to dynamic, real-time guidance.**

## The Problem

Travelers often spend hours meticulously planning trips, only to have them ruined by unexpected weather, traffic, or a change of heart. Existing AI planners provide a one-time, static itinerary, forcing users to constantly manually adapt their plans. This leaves travelers stressed and disconnected from the spontaneous joy of exploration.

## Our Solution

**Genius Loci** is a dynamic, AI-powered travel co-pilot that adapts to your journey in real-time. It's not just a planner; it's a living guide that helps you discover the "spirit of the place" as you go.

## Key Features

- **Hyper-Personalized Itinerary Engine:** We generate a "flexible" itinerary based on your unique "Traveler Archetype" and interests.
- **Real-Time Contextual Adaptation:** Our app automatically adjusts your plan based on live weather, traffic, and your current location.
- **Spontaneous Discovery:** We suggest nearby hidden gems and local favorites as you walk around.
- **Seamless Booking:** A single-click option to book accommodations and transport.

## Tech Stack

This project is built on the power of Google's cutting-edge technologies:

- **Generative AI:** Gemini Pro via Vertex AI for itinerary generation and adaptation.
- **Geospatial Data:** Google Maps API for real-time location tracking and routing.
- **Web Framework:** Flask (Python) for the web application's backend.
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

## How It Works

1.  **Input:** The user provides their destination, duration, and "Traveler Archetype."
2.  **Generation:** Our Gemini-powered backend generates a flexible itinerary.
3.  **Adaptation:** The app continuously monitors real-time data (weather) and, if conditions change, a function is triggered to generate a new, adapted itinerary.
4.  **Display:** The updated itinerary is presented to the user.

## Future Scope

- Full booking integration with EMT inventory.
- User-generated content features to build a community of travelers.
- A mobile application with push notifications for real-time alerts.
